# todo: need to setup a database
# todo: initial trade hypothesis: if price increases each hour over previous two hours, then I should buy as it will increase again soon


# Trade Hypothesis 1: If price increases each hour over 2 hours, the next hour will see another price rise
# Trade Hypothesis 2: If price stops increasing hour over hour, I should sell as it will fall soon
# Considerations: Optimising this algorithm will take time, as I will have limited resources to trade ALL rising stocks
# Benchmark against: BTC, ETH, EOS and BNB


# Function to get the price movement of BTC

    BTC = "Blah"
